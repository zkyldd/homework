Formal method for the development of the computer system is a mathematical technique based on the description of system properties.Formal method that provides a framework, the framework and in system rather than a particular way of development and verification system.The essence of formal methods is to describe a technique properties of the target software system based on a mathematical approach.
Different models suitable for different types of software testing.Software model is the abstract description of the behavior of the software and the software structure.The generation of test cases used to test the model dependence. The finite state machine model for example, sequence tagged traversal path arc formation is the test case. In the path construction meet the testing standards, constrained conditions must be taken into account, such as path length constraints, statistical tests should also consider the migration probability
