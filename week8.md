With the development of software testing, test method is also more and more diverse and  selection of software testing method allows us to more appropriate.

Let us use the "diandiandanci" for example.

When the software developed completely,we should take unit testing and integration testing.Unit testing is the small scale test; to test a function or a block of code. Typically done by the programmer and not a tester to do, because it needs to know the internal details of the program design and coding of knowledge. This work is not easy to do, unless the application system architecture design a very good; also may need to develop test driver module or test suite.Integration testing is the logical extension of unit test. The simplest form of it is: two have been tested unit into an assembly, and test the interface between them. In a sense, component refers to the integration of the aggregation of multiple unit. In real programs, many unit into components, and these components are grouped into a larger portion of the program. Method is a combination of test pieces, and finally the expansion process, will your module test and other groups of modules. Finally, all modules will constitute the process with the test. In addition, if the program is composed of a plurality of process, should be paired to test them, rather than at the same time to test all the process.

At secondï¼Œwe shoule take user interface testing.User interface testing refers to test whether the user interface style to meet customer requirements, the text is correct, whether the page appearance, text, picture composition is perfect, the operation is friendly. UI's goal is to ensure that the user interface will pass the test object function for the user to provide the corresponding access or browsing function. To ensure that the user interface in accordance with company or industry standard. Including user friendliness, user-friendly, easy operation test.

After user interface testing,we take white box testing and black box testing to ensure the quality of a software.White box testing is to test object as an open box. Dynamic tests were carried out using white box testing method, the internal structures and processes need to test software product, do not need to test the functionality of software products.White box testing is to know the product internal work process, through the test to detect the product internal action is in accordance with the provisions of the specifications of the normal, according to the structure test program within the program, each path checking whether the program has a predetermined work correctly, regardless of its function, mainly white box testing method have the logical drive, ground testing, mainly for software verification.Black box testing is based on the software of the specification of software testing, the test does not consider the operation of the principle of software, so software as a black box to the user.Software testers in the user's point of view, through a variety of output results for various input and observation software to find the defects in the software, but do not care about a software testing method to the realization of the program.

At last,we take acceptance testing (UAT).We provide a Bate version for the user, make the user experience, and at any time feedback
